# Driving Style Classification Project Repository

Rodrigo Almeida - G00377123

## Overview
This repository contains the work and analysis performed for the machine learning project focused on classifying driving styles based on various parameters collected 
through On-Board Diagnosis II (OBD-II) interfaces in vehicles and accelerometers embedded in smartphones. The project utilizes several machine learning algorithms to predict driving styles, emphasizing the differences in performance across Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and k-nearest Neighbors (kNN) models.

## Repository Structure

### .gitignore: 
Ensures temporary files and folders not essential for version control are ignored.

### project.ipynb: 
A comprehensive Jupyter notebook containing the analysis, comparisons of machine learning models, and visualizations of the dataset and results.
Click on the Badge to access the Jupyter Notebook.

### Project Documentation in LaTeX
This repository also includes a detailed project write-up in LaTeX format, with an analysis and documentation of the research conducted. The LaTeX document covers methodologies, results, and conclusions in detail. You can find this document in the repository named `main.tex` or he compiled version `main.pdf`.
